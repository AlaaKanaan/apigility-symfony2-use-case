This is an extended version of the proof of concept code that has been presented by [Stefan Koopmanschap](http://www.stefankoopmanschap.com/) and [Enrico Zimuel](http://www.zimuel.it) during the [PHP Forum Paris 2013](http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/). We would like to thanks [Alessandro Nadalin](http://odino.org/) for the suggestion that he gave us about the bootstrap "hack" part of Symfony2.
